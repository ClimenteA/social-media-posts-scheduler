## Get social media OAuth2 ids and secrets

For all of them you need to search for developer + X or developer + Linkedin etc. to go to the platform where you can create an app and get the keys needed for integrating with their api. Search for "How to make posts via Linkedin/X/Facebook/etc api" you will find some up to date docs on what steps you need to take. Check .env.example for the needed ids and secrets.


## Quickstart

While developing:
- `make dev` - start django app;
- `make poster` - start background social media poster (needs manual restarts on changes);

Use ngrok for `APP_URL` in `.env` file for Google auth callback and social media callbacks;

Project is using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for managing dependencies.

- `uv sync` - install all packages;
- `uv sync --upgrade` - install all packages at their latest versions;
- `uv add package` - add a package in dependencies;
- `uv remove package` - remove a package from dependencies;

Shortcut make commands:

- `make migrate-all` - migrate all models changes;
- `make purge-db` - delete all data and migration dirs;
- `make poster` - start post scheduler;
- `docker network create web` - one time thing;
- `make start` - start app in docker;
- `make stop` - stop app in docker;
- `make build` - build app in docker;
- `make applogs` - show app logs in docker;


## Google SignIn Configuration

- Google [google console](https://console.cloud.google.com/);
- Create a new project;
- Configure OAuth2 consent page;
- Setup Branding (name, support email, logo, app domain, authorized domain) - that's when app goes to prod;
- In Clients page click `Create client` button add name set authorized JS origins (http://ngrok-for-dev for dev, http://ngrok-for-dev/complete/google-oauth2/ for dev redirect uri). Change it with your domain once app is ready for prod.
- Download secrets (you have later access to them as well);
- In the `.env` file fill `SOCIAL_AUTH_GOOGLE_OAUTH2_KEY` and `SOCIAL_AUTH_GOOGLE_OAUTH2_SECRET` with Cliend ID and Client Secret taken from previously downloaded json file with secrets;


## Facebook && Instagram

- You'll need a Facebook Public Page and an Instagram Professional account linked into Meta bussiness account;
- Google [meta developer social technologies](https://developers.facebook.com/);
- Create an app;
- Setup `Facebook login for business` there in add Settings:

    - Allowed Domains for the JavaScript SDK: ngrok-or-prod-url.app;
    - Deauthorize callback URL: https://ngrok-or-prod-url.app/facebook/uninstall/;
    - Data Deletion Request URL: https://ngrok-or-prod-url.app/facebook/uninstall/;
    - Save changes;
- Get App ID (FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID) and App secret (FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET) from App Settings > Basic and fill .env file;


## X

- A single X account is enough here;
- Google [x developer portal](https://developer.x.com/en/portal/dashboard);
- Create an app and generate OAuth 2.0 Client ID and Client Secret save them to .env;
- On User authentication settings click Edit button;
- Select Type of App > Web App and fill Callback URI / Redirect URL > https://ngrok-or-prod-url.app/X/callback/;

- Click Save button;


## Linkedin

- You'll need a Linkedin Company Page, posts will be made to the Linkedin account not the company page;
- Google [linkedin developer](https://developer.linkedin.com/);
- Create an app, link the Company Page;
- For Oauth2 select the following scopes: openid, profile, w_member_social, email;
- In Auth tab set the callback url: https://ngrok-or-prod-url.app/linkedin/callback/;
- Update .env file with Client ID (LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID) and Primary Client Secret (LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET);


## TikTok
